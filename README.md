Team Profile Generator

## Description

This project generates a Readme file from user input on the command line. When the user calls for 
node and the javascript file, then they will be prompted with questions. Their input will be the content
created in the Readme file including: the title, a description, installation instructions, usage information,
contribution guidelines and test instructions. It also includes the license for the application with a badge icon,
the GitHub username and email.

## Installation

Node.js needs to be installed as well as the npm package, which gives us the inquirer and fs package, and
these are required for the application to work.

## Usage

The screen shots below shows the prompt of questions with answers. It also shows a successfully generated Readme.
