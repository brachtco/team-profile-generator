# Title
Team Profile Generator

## Description

The Team Profile Generator creates an HTML page from user input on the command line. When the user calls for 
node and the index.js file, then they will see a menu with the roles Manager, Engineer and Intern. When the user clicks on Manger they will be prompted with questions and will then input answers. They will do the same with Engineer and Intern. The project also contains testing files to make sure that code is working.

## Installation

Node.js needs to be installed as well as the npm package, which gives us the inquirer and jest package. Inquirer is need to show our menu and questions. Jest is needed to run the tests.
